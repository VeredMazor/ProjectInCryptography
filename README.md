decrypted image verified with MAC (Message authentication code). The secret key of
Cast-256 is delivered with EC El-Gamal.

### Thanks to Jewpigeon for implementing Cast-256 and CBC mode.

 ** The project does not contain a server client implementation, Just only the flow of how everything should connect together.
